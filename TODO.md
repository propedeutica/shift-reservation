#List of things to do:
Please look at [Issues](https://github.com/propedeutica/shift-reservation/issues) for an up to date list:
- ~~Devise for users~~
- ~~Devise for admins~~
- Create offspring and assign them to shifts
- Improvement in reports to show users and offspring, and assignments (i.e. showing admins all the information)
- Admins should be able to modify users
- Change to nested routes to reflect structure (non-authenticated, user-authenticated, admin-authenticated)
- Translation into Spanish
- ~~Installation instructions (configuration options)~~
- Mail for Devise
- Mail for all other events
- Allow admin to see the interface as one of the users (impersonate a user)
- 100% test coverage (expect action-job not to be there)

**Thank you for taking the time to help :D**
